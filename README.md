# Can Stadium AI

Welcome to the Can Stadium AI project! This repository contains code and resources for simulating, analyzing, and visualizing crowd and queue management in stadium environments using machine learning and agent-based modeling.

## Project Structure

- **api/**: Backend API for serving models and data
- **dashboard/**: Streamlit dashboard for visualization and interaction
- **frontend/**: React-based web frontend
- **ml/**: Machine learning models and utilities
- **simulation/**: Agent-based simulation code
- **data/**: Raw and processed datasets
- **models/**: Saved model files
- **notebook/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and evaluation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js (for frontend)
- pip (Python package manager)

### Backend Setup
1. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r api/requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the API server:
   ```bash
   python run_api.py
   ```
3. Run the dashboard:
   ```bash
   python run_dashboard.py
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the React app:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
- Access the dashboard via the provided local URL after running the backend and frontend.
- Explore simulation results, ML predictions, and stadium analytics.
